2. **Forking and Renaming**: If relevant, fork this repository, rename it to match your project's name, and indicate that it is a NFRs document.

3. **Disabling Unneeded Requirements**: Instead of removing non-essential requirements, disable them (e.g., make them gray) to maintain a comprehensive list for future reference.

6. **Ensure Understanding**: Verify that all developers and a PM have a clear understanding of the requirements and their priorities as listed in the repository.
